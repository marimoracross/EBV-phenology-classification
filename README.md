# EBV-phenology-classification
Using classification algorithms to extract phenology data from unstructured descriptions

Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) make it possible to evaluate and monitor the state of biodiversity over time and at different spatial scales. Its development is led by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) to harmonize, consolidate, and standardize biodiversity data from varied biodiversity sources. This document presents a mechanism to get baseline data to feed the Species Traits Variable Phenology or other biodiversity indicators by extracting species characters and structure names from morphological descriptions of specimens and classifying the descriptions using machine learning (ML).  

A workflow that performs Classification of morphological descriptions using ML algorithms was evaluated with excellent results. It was implemented using Python, Pytorch,Â Scikit-Learn, and other libraries applied to 106,804 herbarium records from the National Biodiversity Institute of Costa Rica (INBio). The text classification results were almost excellent (F1 score between 96% and 99%) using three traditional ML methods: Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB), Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC), and Logistic Regression (LR).
